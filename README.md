### The MERN Stack...Because I want to
The M.E.R.N. stack is a JavaScript stack used for deployment of full-stack web applications.
* **MongoDB** - document database
* **Express** - Node web framework
* **React** - a client-side JavaScrip library (see reactjs.org)
* **Node** - the premier JavaScript web server

I am continuing to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript along with ReactJS and Node so it was a natural fit to start this project

### Libraries needing to be installed
* Express - `npm i --save express`
* Body-parser - `npm i --save body-parser`
* Mongoose - `npm i --save mongoose `
* Nodemon - `npm i --save nodemon`
* Concurrently - `npm i --save concurrently`

In this project we use `Express.js`, a very popular framework for `Node.js` applications.
`Body-parser` is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
`Mongoose` is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

`nodemon` is a package that runs the `node.js` application and listen to any file change, updating the entire app.
`Concurrently` allows us to run multiple npm commands at the same time.
